          by events outside our reasonable control.

        <p className="text-black text-base font-normal">
          24.3.1. not reasonably foreseeable (this means that it was not obvious
          that it would happen and nothing you said to us before using the
          Services meant we should have expected it);

        <p className="text-black text-base font-normal">
          24.3.2. caused by a failure by you to comply with these Terms;

          update); or

          negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or
          subcontractors or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

        <p className="text-black text-base font-normal">
          29.1. Each of the clauses of these Terms operates separately. If any
          court or relevant authority decides that any of them (as a whole, or
          partially) are unlawful, the remaining clauses (or part of them) will
          remain in full force and effect.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black text-base font-normal">
          29.2. These Terms are personal to you. You may only transfer your
          rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we
          agree to this in writing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black text-base font-normal">
          29.3. We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to
          another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this
          happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your
          rights under these Terms.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black text-base font-normal">
          29.4. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are
          required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps
          against you in respect of your breaking your contract with us, that
          will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not
          prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black text-base font-normal">
          29.5. These Terms are between you and us. No other person shall have
